Information screens developed for Universities, available to all

## Who
Primarily designed for our in-house needs at the University of Gloucestershire, this system has been developed to be both flexible and scalable.  It should therefore be a solution that can be utilised many and varied settings outside of the HE sector.

## Why
The education sector is traditionally about co-operating, sharing knowledge and expertise.  This project is following in those footsteps.

## What
We run the system on a LAMP stack but if you want something else feel free to experiment and hack.

##
Raise and issue and talk about your idea, fork the project to work on the code and submit a pull request.
